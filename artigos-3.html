Images, sounds, emotions,  sensations from the objective world are brain processed in ways clearly shown  by modern neurosciences. With well-advanced MRIs, researchers are able to  detect and record the most “refined” kinds of energy working throughout the  brain pathways. In our modern world Psychoanalysis and Neuroscience walk hand  in hand mutually contributing to one another as new developments keep arising.</p>            	  <p>But the real  nature of the psyche still is beyond the comprehension of Neurosciences,  Neurology, Psychopathology, Psychiatry, or science in general. </p>            	  <p>Jung  postulates that images and objects could assume the character of consciousness  only once they come into association with the ego. If the images do not get  associated with the ego they remain unconscious. The lost of memory is one  typical example of this psychological phenomena. </p>            	  <p>Therefore  consciousness is directed associated with the ego. For Jung there are four  consciousness functions; senses and reason, imagination and understanding.<br />                      Jung makes  the comparison with a beam of torchlight. Everything that enters the beam light  becomes conscious, everything out of the beam light, unconscious. Everything  seen, heard, felt, sensed is also subliminally stored in the unconscious  without us even noticing it.  </p>            	  <p>It is  important to note though, that the images of experiences lived, even when in  the unconscious, do not cease to exist. Because we do not see them it does not  mean they are not there, they are simply not conscious to the ego, Jung says. </p>            	  <p>They can  become what Jung called “autonomous psychological complexes”. These can vary  from pleasant memories from childhood with luminosity still is sparking through  time, to terrible traumatic experiences involving all sorts of painful  psychological and physical abuse.<br />                      Normally the  latter, for being disturbing and unpleasant, are repressed consciously or  unconsciously by the individual’s “psyche self-defence mechanism”, which pushes  the bad experience down through the threshold to the deep depth of the  unconscious. <br />                      Some of them  may never come back and about and are therefore forever forgotten by our  conscious mind; nevertheless, some of these psychic complexes, depending of  their energy level, may still make themselves present to consciousness  “every-now-and-then”, and without our will, consent or conscious control. Depending  of the intensity of the experiences and the amount of libido (energy) created,  they may remain active for a very long period of time, sometimes even for  decades.  They may manifest themselves in  our attitudes, moods, in our speech, hearing, in visions, in dreams, etc. <br />                      In cases of  severe mental illness they may be permanent and of much strong intensity.</p>            	  <p>But even in a  smaller scale, i.e. for the not so neurotic individual, that phenomenon happens  often and is considered ‘normal’. Small lapses of memory like; why did I come  to this room for? You forget the name of your friend while introducing him/her  to another person, you are looking for something that is already in your hands,  or even saying something terribly shocking to somebody as a total slip of the  tongue and without meaning it at all. </p>            	  <p>There are  numerous examples of these occurrences on daily basis and they happen to most  of us. Freud called some of this phenomena “parapraxis” which is when  autonomous complexes from the unconscious suddenly have an outburst of energy  crossing the threshold taking charge of consciousness in a momentum. And again,  in severe mental illness this phenomenon happens much more frequent and in much  higher scale of potency, which is the case in patients suffering from acute  neurosis, schizophrenia, hysteria etc. Jung described a neurotic when ‘his  consciousness is over flooded with unconscious material’. </p>            	  <p>Jung argues  that the unconscious should be regarded as <br />                      “ A natural  organ with its own specific creative energy”. </p>            	  <p>Below is how  Jung defines the contents of the Unconscious in his most distinctive way: </p>            	  <p>&nbsp;</p>            	  <p>- Everything  of which I know, but of which I am not thinking at the moment. </p>            	  <p>- Everything  of which I was once conscious, but have now forgotten. </p>            	  <p>- Everything  perceived by my senses, but not noticed by my conscious mind. </p>            	  <p>- Everything  which involuntary and without paying attention to it, I feel, think, remember  and do. </p>            	  <p> - All the future things which are taking shape  on me and will sometime come to conscious. <br />                      All these are  contents of the unconscious. </p>            	  <p>- Besides  these we must include all the more or less intentional repression of painful  thoughts and feelings”.</p>            	  <p>Jung has  postulated that the unconscious has also a compensatory function to  consciousness. Hence the dreams, daydreams, and fantasies, which have been  occurring to mankind since records began. </p>            	  <p>“For many  years I have carefully analysed about 2,000 dreams per annum, thus I have  acquired a certain experience in this matter”. C.G. Jung wrote in 1954, when he  was seventy-nine.</p>            	  <p>The profound  knowledge of Alchemy, Greek mythology, Indigenous cultures, Classic and  Oriental philosophy, Psychiatry, Descartes, Kant, Goethe, Nietzsche, Flournoir,  Freud… and others, made Jung our modern times ‘sage’ of dream analysis. </p>            	  <p>So vast is  his material in the subject that I would like to quote only a few of his  memorable definitions of dreams: </p>            	  <p>&nbsp;</p>            	  <p>DREAMS</p>            	  <p>- A dream is  a psychic product originating in the sleeping state without conscious  motivation. In a dream, consciousness is not completely extinguished; there’s  always a small remnant left. In most dreams for instance, there is still some  consciousness of the ego, although is a very limited and curiously distorted  ego known as the dream-ego. It is a mere fragment or shadow of the waking ego.  (CW 8 - p305)</p>            	  <p>- As in our  waking state, real people and things enter our field of vision, so the  dream-images enter like another kind of reality into the field of consciousness  of the dream-ego.  We do not feel as if  we were producing dreams, it is rather as if the dreams come to us. They do not  subject to our control but obey their own laws. They are obviously autonomous  psychic complexes, which form themselves out of their own material. We do not  know the source of their motives, and we therefore say that the dreams come  from the unconscious.  (CW 8 - p305)   </p>            	  <p>- The  existence of unrealized unconscious fantasies increases the frequency and  intensity of dreams, and when these fantasies are made conscious the dreams  change their character and become weaker and less frequent. From this we can  conclude that dreams often contains fantasies, which “want” to become  conscious. </p>            	  <p>&nbsp;</p>            	  <p>- Dreams do  not deceive, do not distort, lie or disguise, they invariably seek to express  something that the ego does not understand (or know). A dream is a spontaneous  self-portrayal in symbolic form of the actual situation in the  unconscious.  </p>            	  <p>- Just as the  body reacts purposively to injuries or infections or any abnormal condition, so  the psyche functions react to unnatural or dangerous disturbances with  purposive defence mechanisms. Among these purposive reactions we must include  the dreams.  <br />                      (CW 8 – p253)</p>            	  <p>- During the  First World War, soldiers in the field dreamt far less of the war than their  homes. Military psychiatrists considered it a basic principle that a man should  be pulled out of the front lines when he started dreaming too much of war  scenes, for that meant he no longer possessed any psychic defences against  impressions from outside. (CW 8 - p303)</p>            	  <p>- Just as conscious  psychic activity creates certain products, so unconscious psychic activity  produces dreams, fantasies etc. It is idle to speculate on how great a share  consciousness has in dreams. <br />                      A dream  presents itself to us: we do not consciously create it. Conscious reproduction,  or even the perception of it, certainly alters the dreams in many ways, without  however, doing away with the basic fact of the unconscious source of creative  activity. <br />                      (CW 6 – p485)</p>            	  <p>- “The  unconscious… has a compensatory function to consciousness. What the unconscious  is itself is an idle speculation… By its very nature it is beyond all  cognition. We merely postulate its existence from its products, such as dreams  and fantasies. But it is a well-established fact of scientific experience that  dreams, for example, practically always have a content that could correct the  consciousness attitude, and this justifies us in speaking of a compensatory  function of the unconscious”. (CW 6 – p520)</p>            	  <p>On the nature  of the “big” dreams Jung postulates that images from the “Collective  unconscious” or “Physic heritage”, and the “archetypes”, are their source and  composition. In his opinion the instincts and the archetypes together form the  collective unconscious. He calls it collective because, unlike the personal  unconscious, the collective unconscious is not made of individual-unique  characteristics, but of universal, regular, and collective occurrence. Like the  instincts, the collective unconscious is a regular phenomenon common to all  mankind. </p>            	  <p>The  archetypes share the same qualities of the instincts therefore common to all  mankind too. Jung found the same mythological archetypal similarities on dreams  of his patients in Basel and the aboriginals in Australia. And the same  similarities he found between African Americans and Arian Europeans, and  between the insane and the not insane too. </p>            	  <p>It is  important to emphasize though that from the Jungian psychological standpoint  there were five main groups of instinctive factors; hunger, sexuality,  creativity, activity and reflection. </p>            	  <p>Reflection  being the cultural instinct “par excellence”.  <br />                      (CW8 p 114)</p>            	  <p>Jung believed  that “man is not born a “tabula rasa” but with a brain which is the result of  the development of a long chain of ancestors”. (CW 8 p 372) </p>            	  <p>“If the  collective unconscious did not exist, everything could be achieved by  education; one could reduce a human being to a psychic machine with impunity,  or transform him in an ideal”(CW8 p373).</p>            	  <p>In the last  analysis, the collective unconscious is “a deposit of world processes embedded  in the structure of the brain and the sympathetic nervous system”. (CW8 p373)</p>            	  <p>&nbsp;</p>            	  <p>THE SELF</p>            	  <p>&nbsp;</p>            	  <p>                                               <img width="280" height="215" src="images/magnus2.jpg" alt=":Psyche.jpg" /> <br />                      By “self “ we  understand, as an empirical concept, “the whole range of psychic phenomena in  man. It expresses the unity of the personality as a whole”. (CW vol. 6, p 460) </p>            	  <p>And by “soul”  we understand “a clearly demarcated functional complex that can best be  described as a personality.  (CW vol. 6,  p 463) </p>            	  <p>For Jung the  unity of Self and Soul represented the reason of our own existence. And this  unity, or personality, has also its unique characteristics for each one of us.  Our unconscious does not only act on an instinctive and collective way but also  in a subjective and personal one. </p>            	  <p>Here we  arrive to Jung’s description of the Ego.<br />                      Even if the  ego occupies the centre of the psyche in the whole of the self (diagram), it  does not represent the totality of it.<br />                      The ego could  best be described as a psychic complex with the nature of consciousness. Hence  that Jung spoke of “ego-complex” which would be merely another psychic complex  amongst others.</p>            	  <p>“The ego is a  complex that does not comprise the total human being; it has forgotten  infinitely more than it knows. It has heard and seen an infinite amount of  which it has never become conscious. There are thoughts that spring up beyond  the range of consciousness, fully formed and complete, and it knows nothing of  them. The ego has scarcely even the vaguest notion of the incredible important  regulative function of the sympathetic nervous system in relation to the  internal bodily process. What the ego comprehends is perhaps the smallest part  of what a complete consciousness would have to comprehend”. <br />                      (CW Vol.8 p  324)</p>            	  <p>Clearly the  model of the psyche for Jung was not based on the ego or ego-complex only, but,  and as importantly, on the other complexes too.   If we take the above diagram as a base of understanding the human  psyche, we will realize that ego is part conscious and part unconscious. The  same applies for sensation and intuition. Feeling is deep down right at the  bottom of the unconsciousness, while thinking is entirely conscious.  This classification generated numerous heated  discussions within the psychoanalytic world throughout time, although it has  certainly contributed for the study and understanding of such complex subject  as the psyche.  </p>            	  <p>Though  despite numerous attempts since antiquity to classify and categorize the  differences between individuals, man has never really managed to find a  definite solution for the riddle, perhaps simply because there is not one. </p>            	  <p>Nevertheless,  Jung, through his psychological Types theory, created a principle that has been  applied as a standpoint of observation in many analytical practices in our  modern world, even from those of different schools of psychoanalytical thought.  His contribution of Types is nowadays worldwide recognized as one of the basic  principles of Typology. <br />                      The  Myers-Briggs typology, for instance, is very popular in management training and  business, a fact that clearly shows Jung’s influence even outside the  psychoanalytical field.</p>            	  <p>“… The  assumption that only one psychology exists or only “one “ fundamental  psychological principle is an intolerable tyranny, a pseudo-scientific  prejudice of the common man and his “psychology” as though there were “nothing  but” that psychology. In the same way one always talks of “reality” as though  it were the only one. Reality is simply what works in a human soul and not what  is assumed by certain people to work here and there, and about which prejudiced  generalizations are usually made. Even when this is done in a scientific  spirit, it should not be forgotten that science is not the “summa” of life,  that is actually only one of the forms of human thought”.  (CW vol. 6 p 41)</p>            	  <p>Freely  borrowing from Physiology and Goethe, Jung used Diastole and Systole as bases  to develop his theory of “Extraversion” and “Introversion” of personal types. <br />                      Diastole in  Physiology means when the heart relaxes and lets the blood flow into it.  Systole, by the reverse, is when the heart muscles contract pumping the blood  out of it. </p>            	  <p>As Jung  himself puts it, the names and concepts to describe the mechanism of  introversion and extraversion can be many accordingly to the observer in  question; nevertheless, Jung perhaps preferred these terms by his fascination  for Goethe’s Faust. </p>            	  <p>In Goethe’s  Faust the ‘intuitive’ author uses the same metaphor to describe the conflict  between Faust and Mephistopheles, or the conflict between conscious and  unconscious, good and evil, the destroyer but also the saviour… all rested on  the pact to sell his soul to the devil… but at the end being the same and one  person. This is probably how Jung felt during his period of Individuation,  accordingly to some authors, when he saw himself as being the opposite of  Goethe, the latter being the extraverted one. </p>            	  <p>“Extraversion  is an outward-turning of libido (energy).<br />                      Everyone in  the extraverted state thinks, feels, and acts in relation to the object… In a  sense extraversion is a transfer of interest from subject to object…  Extraversion is ‘active’ when intentional and ‘passive’ when the object compels  it, i.e. when the object attracts the subjective interest on its own accord,  even against his will. When extraversion is habitual we speak of an extraverted  type”. <br />                      (CW vol. 6  p427)</p>            	  <p>“Introversion  is an inward-turning of the libido (energy), in the sense of a negative  relation of subject to object. Interest does not move towards the object but  withdraws from it in the subject. Everyone whose attitude is introverted  thinks, feels, and acts in a way that clearly demonstrates that the subject is  the prime motivating factor and that the object is of secondary importance.  Introversion may be intellectual or emotional, just as it can be characterized  by “sensation and intuition”. It is active when the subject voluntary shuts  himself from the object, passive when he is unable to restore the object the  libido streaming back from it. When introversion is habitual, we speak of an  introverted type.<br />                      (CW vol. 6  p452)</p>            	  <p>We all can be  Introverts or extraverts, depending of the situation we find ourselves in.  There is also a genetically inherited condition, which may be an influence on  the intensity of one type or another.  </p>            	  <p>For Otto  Gross the extraverted type represents the “civilizing genius” and the introvert  type the “cultural genius”, the former for practical achievement and the latter  for abstract invention.</p>            	  <p>Extraverts  and Introverts can also be subdivided by the four psychological functions. We  then end up with eight categorical types: Extravert thinking type, extravert  sensation type, extravert intuitive type and extravert feeling type. And the  same for the Introvert thinking type, introvert sensation type, introvert  intuitive type and introvert feeling type. <br />                      This qualification  was divided into rational and irrational concepts, the former represented by  judging/perceiving and the latter by sensing/intuiting, making them all  together of sixteen psychological types.</p>            	  <p>In reality  these functions are never uniform in actual life. There is always a  predominance of one of them while the others stay on the background, i.e. one  cannot be emotional whilst thinking rationally. <br />                      Some  individuals are guided in their lives by their feelings, others by their  intellectual thinking, others by their sensation and finally others by their  intuition. These people can be extraverts or introverts depending of their  cultural environment and genetic formation. There are optimistic introverts as  well as optimistic extraverts, and both can be pessimists.</p>            	  <p>“Classification  does not explain the individual’s psyche. Nevertheless, an understanding of  psychological types opens the way to a better understanding of human psychology  in general”. (CW 6 p 516)</p>            	  <p>&nbsp;</p>            	  <p>SOUL: ANIMA,  ANIMUS, PERSONA, SHADOW. </p>            	  <p>&nbsp;</p>            	  <p>“More clearly,  perhaps, than any other science, psychology demonstrates the spiritual  transition from the classical age to the modern. The history of psychology up  to seventeenth century consists essentially in the enumeration of doctrines  concerning the ‘soul’, but the ‘soul’ was never able to get a word in as the  object investigated”.</p>            	  <p>So Jung  developed a theory, which would characterize the soul within four psychological  concepts: anima/us, ego, persona and shadow. He called this idea “Functional  complexes” or “ the Personality”.</p>            	  <p>&nbsp;</p>            	  <p>When he  speaks of soul as ‘anima’ he refers to the feminine aspect of all men. A  masculine man, for example, has a feminine soul, or anima, while a feminine  woman has a masculine soul, or an animus.<br />                      If we take  the persona of a man as his exterior “face”, he is showing his natural animus  to the world, so we expect him to have anima as soul. The reason is a  complementary one, Jung argues.  The  anima usually has all those qualities, which are lacking on the conscious  attitude of a masculine man.</p>            	  <p>“… This  explains why it is just those very virile men who are most subject to  characteristic weakness and impressionability. Conversely, it is often just the  most feminine women who, in their inner lives, display an intractability, an  obstinacy, and a wilfulness that are to be found with comparable intensity only  in a man’s outer attitude. These are masculine traits which, excluded from the  womanly outer attitude, have become qualities of her soul, therefore she has a  soul as animus”.</p>            	  <p>Departing  from the standpoint that the ‘Soul’ is the same as ‘personality’ or anima,  animus, it would lead us to think that    dissociation of personality must exist within the realm of normality.  ‘Angel abroad, devil at home’ or vice versa, is a form of character split very  common on our everyday experience. Depending of the identification of the ego  with the situation, and if it becomes a habitual attitude, then the individual  will develop a split personality, one adapted to the domestic life, another to  the public one or the ‘persona’. This is a common case widespread in our  society. </p>            	  <p>Jung defines  persona as; “…the individual’s system of adaptation…to the world. Every calling  or profession, for example, has its own characteristic persona… One could say,  with little exaggeration, that the persona is that which in reality one is not,  but which oneself as well as others thinks one is”. (CW9, para 221)</p>            	  <p>Since we have  talked about the ego, anima/us and the persona, we now bring the fourth, and  the trickiest, functional complex on spot, the ‘Shadow’.</p>            	  <p>The shadow as  I understand it, is the dark, mysterious, nebulous part of the unconscious  personality with a collective origin.</p>            	  <p>&nbsp;</p>            	  <p>“The shadow  is the thing a person has no wish to be”. <br />                      (CW16 para  470)</p>            	  <p>“The shadow  is that hidden, repressed for the most part, inferior and guilt-laden  personality whose ultimate ramifications reach back into the realm of our  animal ancestors and so comprise the whole historical aspect of the  unconscious… It has been believed hitherto that the human shadow was the source  of all evil, it can now be ascertain on closer investigation that the  unconscious man, that is, his shadow, does not consist only of morally  reprehensible tendencies, but also displays a number of good qualities, such as  normal instincts, appropriate reaction, realistic insights, creative impulses,  etc.”. (CW 9 paras 422&amp;423)</p>            	  <p>On the latter  definition Jung notes that the shadow is also home for creativity, rationality,  strength and other good qualities of the human psyche. But the bad aspects of  the shadow can be in general overwhelming. The egotistic character of this  aspect of our personality is somehow disturbing. One tends to project his own  negative aspects on others. We should realize that in general all the bad  qualities that we see in others in reality come from us. It is easy to project  and blame others for our own intolerance of things.  </p>            	  <p>“We simply  accuse our enemy of our own un-admitted faults…” “War psychology has made this  abundantly clear: everything my country does is good, everything the others do  is bad…” “Because the individual has this same primitive psychology, every  attempt to bring this age old projections to consciousness is felt irritating.  Naturally one would like to have better relations with one fellows, but only on  the condition that ‘they’ live up to ‘our’ expectations –in other words- that  they become willing carriers of our projections”. (CW 8 p 271)</p>            	  <p>So the reason  for so many conflicts and human atrocities around the world over the history of  mankind is pretty clear. Evil is also part of nature in the formation of man’s  psyche. <br />                      Jung believed  that only through self-knowledge man would be able to minimize and/or perhaps,  finally end the conflicts caused by this age-old instinct. </p>            	  <p>“Today we  need Psychology for reasons that involve our own very existence. We stand  perplexed and stupefied before the phenomenon of Nazism and Bolshevism, because  we know nothing about man or at any rate have only a partial and distorted  picture of him. If we had self-knowledge, that would not be the case. We stand  face to face with the terrible question of evil and do not even know what is  before us, let alone what to pit against it”. <br />                      (Memories,  Dreams, Reflections p 363)</p>            	  <p>Jung believed  that touching evil though carried the risk of succumbing to it. Therefore we  should not succumb to either one, good or evil. Succumbing to either would  create one-sidedness, a kind of addiction that does not make a healthy  personality either. </p>            	  <p>“Evil needs  to be pondered just as much as good, for good and evil are ultimately nothing  but ideal extensions and abstractions of doing, and both belong to the  “chiaroscuro” of life… in the last resort there is no good that cannot produce  evil and no evil that cannot produce good”. <br />                      (CW 12, p 31)</p>            	  <p>…So the  danger threatening us all comes from the psyche of the individual and the mass,  not from nature… “If certain persons lose their head nowadays, a hydrogen bomb  will go off” (Memories dreams reflections, p 154).</p>            	  <p>Self-knowledge,  then, is crucial for the survival and psychological development of mankind.  This process of self-knowledge Jung called “Individuation”.  </p>            	  <p>Individuation  is a natural process that occurs to all of us in a certain period of our lives.  Normally between late mid-thirties and late forties. It is the time when the  individual start ceasing of being a communal self to become an individual with  his own assertions of things and own opinions. He is no longer so much  influenced by mass behaviour, but will, instead, develop his own personal  characteristic attitudes to life. Even though, most of us are never able to  dissociate ourselves completely from mass behaviour and thinking, the process  of individuation is crucial to differentiate ourselves. We humans are social  animals by nature and naturally influence one another in many distinctive  ways.  </p>            	  <p>The  individuation process, for some, brings man back to his inside, to his  subjective world, which most certainly will be full of new discoveries and  realizations of his own self. </p>            	  <p>It could be  called the ‘ripe’ of the man’s soul, when death appears more at sight and  existential questions inevitably start to arise. ‘Meaning is all the search  then’. <br />                      So the  process of individuation is crucial for the development of mankind. If the  populations were composed of balanced, healthy psyche individuals, a lot more  trouble could have been and be avoided in our world.</p>            	  <p>To resume in  a minimalistic way the vast material Jung wrote about the psyche:  self-knowledge of one’s own Psyche would  represent a positive collective transformation which could spare mankind from a  lot of suffering and despair. <br />                      A man must be  capable to know his capacity for doing good and evil. And as Jung has put it in  1906: “Modern man is rich in knowledge, but poor in wisdom”.  <br />                      It looks like  not much has changed in the world since then.</p>            	  <p>&nbsp;</p>            	  <p>&nbsp;</p>            	  <p>M.C.
